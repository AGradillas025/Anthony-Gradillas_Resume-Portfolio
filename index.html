    <h1>Hello everyone, my name is Anthony Sebastion Andre Gradillas</h1>
    <h2>Biography:</h2>
    <p>Hello the name is Anthony, but some people like to call me Tony. I was born and raised in Glendale Arizona. When
      I was young I went to Discovery Elementary School. In middle school I was not apart of any clubs, because we
      didn't really have any, but I did play a few sports, basketball is my favorite, though I did great in school I
      worked
      really hard on keeping my grades up. Once I had my promotion from middle school to highschool I was quite
      nervous, becasue I was told it was a lot harder, but it was quite easy at first in freshmen and sophmore year. In
      sophmore year I was introduced to a new schooling called West-MEC and the first program I seen in there that
      caught my eye was Coding. Computer Program or coding for short is the process of designing and building a website
      program for
      acomplashing a design for websites. Such as, Google, Apple, Acer, and etc. There are multiple websites out there
      that coders have been apart of to create. Why would I want to</p>
