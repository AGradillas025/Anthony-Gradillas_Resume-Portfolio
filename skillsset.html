        <h2>Skills:</h2>
        <p>I know a decent amount right now I am taking a Coding class to become a future web developer. Although, I do
            know how to work a power tool, but right now I don't know how to drive but I intend to learn this summer. I
            took honors Algebra 1 and honors Geometry, and I almost got into honors Integrated Science and AP Biology.
            I know a decent amount about lights and sound. I participated in quite a few school events that I was hired
            for $10/hour. I planned on joining Math Club in my high school, because I love Math it is pretty easy to
            me, but I got caught in other activities and wasn't able too.</p>
